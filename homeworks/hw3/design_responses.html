							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I didn't know that the typography does really affect our design
							   until I read this article. The more the fancy typography that I have,
							   the nicer the website that I ccould make. Apart of that, I would like
							   to create my own typography for my future website.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>The paragraph that indciates "Identify your audience" is my favorite part of this article.
								Depending on the audience, the designs or types of typography that I decide may vary.
								I am consent to the previous sentence because without identifying the audience's
								age, interests, and cultural upbringing we will not have good typographys.</p>
