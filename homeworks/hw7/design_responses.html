						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The thing that I learned from the article is Proximity, Common Region, Similarity, Closure, Symmetry, Continuity, and Common Fate, is particularly informative and practical. 
								The insights into how these principles can improve the user experience by guiding attention, enhancing organization, and conveying messages clearly are valuable for designers and anyone interested in user interface design.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The favorite part of this article is the interplay between symmetrical and asymmetrical design in creating visually appealing and engaging compositions. It suggests that while symmetrical designs can be satisfying, they may lack dynamism. 
								To make a design more interesting and draw attention, the author recommends incorporating asymmetrical elements, particularly in critical areas like Calls To Action. 
								This concept underscores the importance of finding a balance between symmetry and asymmetry to create designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and engaging.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>“Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?”
